\begin{abstract}  
  We consider the setting of sequential decision making where, at each
  stage, potential actions are evaluated based on expected reduction
  in posterior uncertainty, given by mutual information (MI).  As MI
  typically lacks a closed form, we propose an approach which
  maintains variational approximations of, both, the posterior and MI
  utility.  Our planning objective extends an established variational
  bound on MI to the setting of sequential planning.  The result,
  variational information planning (VIP), is an efficient method for
  sequential decision making.  We further establish convexity of the
  variational planning objective and, under conditional exponential
  family approximations, we show that the optimal MI bound arises from
  a relaxation of the well-known exponential family moment matching
  property.  We demonstrate VIP for sensor selection, experiment
  design, and active learning, where it meets or exceeds methods
  requiring more computation, or those specialized to the 
  task.
