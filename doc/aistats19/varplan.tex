\begin{abstract}
  We consider the planning problem arising from active inference over
  a latent quantity.  Each stage poses a set of actions which must be
  evaluated for their potential reduction in posterior uncertainty.  A
  natural measure of uncertainty reduction is the mutual information
  (MI), which lacks a closed form for non-trivial models.  We propose
  an efficient planning mechanism which maximizes a variational lower
  bound on MI which, when combined with variational inference leads to
  efficient action selection and posterior updates.  We further
  characterize optima of the variational planning objective under
  exponential family approximations and show that optimal bounds arise
  from moment matching conditions under an augmented distribution.  We
  demonstrate our approach on three examples from the literature
  beginning with nonlinear target tracking in a fixed sensor network,
  gene regulatory network inference, and active learning in a
  semi-supervised labeled latent Dirichlet allocation (LLDA) model.
