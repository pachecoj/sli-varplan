In this section we demonstrate the utility of our proposed variational
planning in three scenarios.  First, we consider target state
estimation in a static sensor network where measurements are generated
from a single sensor at each time.  For location dependent observation
noise we see that MI based selection leads to drawing measurements
closest to the predicted target location.  Next, we explore gene
regulatory network under a sparse linear model, as previously studied
in~\cite{seeger2008bayesian, steinke2007experimental}.  While sharing
both approaches share identical EP inference, our planning phase is
based on a valid lower bound to MI, whereas the previous approaches
use heuristic steps to update the local posterior approximation.
Finally, we apply variational planning to topic modeling under the
LLDA model.  Unlike previous models this one contains several nuisance
parameters which must be marginalized out, thus increasing
sample-complexity for Monte Carlo based estimates of the MI objective.
