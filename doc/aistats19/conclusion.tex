We have introduced an approach to sequential decision making (VIP)
which leverages the efficiency of variational approximations to
efficiently produce high quality decisions.  VIP avoids the pitfalls
associated with uncertainty estimates of variational methods, which
can be quite poor, by decoupling the posterior approximation from the
auxiliary model used in planning.  We have shown that the optimization
arising from conditionally exponential family auxiliary models is
convex in the natural parameters.  For simple auxiliary models this
convexity often translates into closed-form solutions, resulting in
high throughput decisions.  Using the same basic methodology we have
shown that VIP can be easily adapted to a variety of contexts, and
performs comparably to methods requiring more computation, such as
MCMC, or to specialized methods in the case of regulatory network
inference.
