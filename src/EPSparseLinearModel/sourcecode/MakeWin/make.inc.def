# LHOTSE: Toolbox for adaptive statistical models

# Module: GLOBAL
# Desc.:  Template for system-dependent part of Makefile
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains system-dependent variables, it is included by
# the main Makefile.
#
# You need to specialize this template to your system. The default
# way is:
# - Copy this file to make.inc.def
# - Edit make.inc.def, specializing it to your system
#
# If you repeatedly compile the LHOTSE sources on different systems,
# the following alternative may be useful:
# - For a system, pick a novel identifier $$$ (lower-case; replace
#   $$$ by the identifier in what follows), such that make.inc.$$$
#   does not already exist
# - Copy this file to make.inc.$$$, edit it to specialize it to the
#   system
# - When calling "make", append the option "where=$$$"

# Absolute path of the project root directory (where the Makefile
# is, and from where the module directories branch off)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# CXXINCS, CXXLDOPTS: C/C++ headers, libraries
# On most systems, these variables do not have to be specified, since
# the C++ compiler is configured appropriately. You may want to
# specify it if you run into problems without, or if you want to use
# a compiler different from the standard one on your system. The
# variable value consists of a sequence of "-I<path>" parts.
# For GCC, the C++ headers are typically found in
# /usr/include/c++/<version> and
# /usr/include/c++/<version>/<system>, and the C headers in
# /usr/lib/gcc-lib/<system>/<version>/include.
# The libraries are typically in
# /usr/lib/gcc-lib/<system>/<version>.
# NOTE: On some systems, the C++ headers have to be specified, while
# the C headers and libraries are found automatically.

# EXLDOPTS_BLAS, EXLIBS_BLAS: BLAS, LAPACK libraries
# LHOTSE requires the LAPACK library and a local variant of the
# BLAS library, furthermore the CBLAS interface to the latter.
# The static libraries (libXXX.a) are used. EXLDOPTS_BLAS contains
# "-L<path>", s.t. the library files are found in <path>.
# EXLIBS_BLAS contains the library string, a sequence of "l<lib>"
# parts.
# A free implementation of the BLAS which is tuned automatically
# to your machine, is given by ATLAS. If you use ATLAS and LAPACK,
# the recommended EXLIBS_BLAS is:
#   -llapack -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas
# Note that the ordering does matter (see ATLAS documentation for
# details). This is also the def. value of EXLIBS_BLAS, which you
# probably do not have to change here.
#
# Contact your system administrator to find out whether LAPACK and
# a suitable BLAS version are present on your system, and where
# these files locate. Note that on many systems installed
# "by default", the static libraries are missing, or the BLAS
# libraries are not tuned to the machine. It is strongly
# recommended to use a BLAS variant tuned to your machine. ATLAS
# sources can be obtained from:
#   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
# See the LHOTSE installation guide for more details.

# EXINCS_MATLAB, MATOPTS: Matlab interface
# LHOTSE can be controlled from Matlab through the MATIF interface,
# which uses the MATLAB MEX interface.
# If EXINCS_MATLAB contains "-I<path>", the MATLAB MEX headers must
# be found in <path>.
# MATOPTS are options to be passed to the "mex" command, apart from
# the usual compiler/linker options.
